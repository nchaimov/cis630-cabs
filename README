MAKE:

You can use ant to build cabs.  Example:
user@host ~$ ant

You can also use make.  Example:
user@host ~$ make

RUN:
If you build with ant you can go into the bin directory and do this:
user@host ~$ java engine.LocalEngine

If you build with make you can run this from the project root directory:
user@host ~$ sh run.sh

Both these methods accept the same command line arguments.  Use --help for
more info.
